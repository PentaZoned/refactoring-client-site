# Refactoring Client Code

The purpose of this project is to refactor a client's code to fit accessibility standards to also cater to those who view the website with disability devices.

The requests include semantic HTML elements, logical structure of styling and positioning for elements, all icons and images should have alt attributes, heading attributes should be in sequential order, and the title should be concise and descriptive.

The functionality of the website should not change and should keep all of its original content. Only the code should be optimized.
